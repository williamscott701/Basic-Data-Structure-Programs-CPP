Write a program that takes a list of integers as its input and stores the integers in the form of the linked list. It then modifies the list such that all even elements in the list appear before all the odd elements in the modified linked list. You need to output the modified list.

Example 1:
Input : ​17->15->8->12->10->5->4->1->7->6->NULL 
Output : ​8->12->10->4->6->17->15->5->1->7->NULL
